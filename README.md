Predicting prices of stock using RNN with LSTM
============================================

Problem Statement:
-----------------------
A daily index of time-varying stock market uncertainty is proposed.
Uncertainty impacts negatively investment, consumption, production and employment.
The impact of uncertainty on stock prices is negative and persistent.

Objective:
-----------------
Developed a recurrent neural network with LSTM which predicted future stock price given a data set of past prices.
The model had a RMSE of 0.05
